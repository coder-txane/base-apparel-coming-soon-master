## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript form validation

### What I learned

I learned how to execute form validation with CSS and JavaScript. This was my first time doing this in a project. I have also grown confidence in using media queries and building responsive designs.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This website helped me grasp a good understanding of form validation!
